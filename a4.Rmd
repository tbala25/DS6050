# Introduction 

The truck factor is `r TF`.

We are going to compute the truck factor of each project. For each file we need to compute its degree of authorship (DOA):

```
DOA = 3.293 + 1.098 * FA + 0.164 * DL - 0.321 * ln(1 + AC)
```
where FA is true if this author is the first author, DL is the number of commits by that author, and AC is the total number of commits by other authors.
